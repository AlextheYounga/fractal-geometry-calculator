# fractalGeometryCalculator

A simple Python program that returns fractal geometric statistics and rescaled ranges from a list of data points or asset prices.

A CSV of the fractal results can be generated in the exports folder or the results can be output in the console.\
This setting can be changed in `def fractalCalculator(output='table'):` to either table or csv.
